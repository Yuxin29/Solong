# 🕹️ so_long

**so_long** is a simple 2D top-down game built with the [MLX42](https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx) graphical library, as part of the 42 core curriculum. The game involves parsing and rendering a map, handling player movement, collecting items, and reaching an exit — all while ensuring proper memory management and error handling.

## 🗺️ Game Rules

- The player (`P`) must collect all collectables (`C`)
- Then reach the exit (`E`) to win
- Walls (`1`) are impassable
- Empty spaces (`0`) are walkable
- Game ends with a win or window close

## 📁 Map Format (`.ber`)

A valid map file must:
- Be rectangular
- Be enclosed by walls
- Contain **1 player**, **1 exit**, and **at least 1 collectable**
- Only use characters: `01PCE`
Example:
111111
1P0C01
100001
1C0E11
111111
